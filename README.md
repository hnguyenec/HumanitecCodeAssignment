# Humanitec Code Assignment
> Create an interface to list Programs (workflowlevel1) and their related Activities
  (workflowlevel2) from our api using redux for Angular (ngrx).

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the application up &
running.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/owezzy/HumanitecCodeAssignment.git
$ cd HumanitecCodeAssignment && npm i
$ npm start 
```
The first command clones a copy of the app from github repo to your local machine.
The second navigates to the root of the application and installs the applications dependencies.
Finally the last command starts an Angular Live Development Server listening on localhost:7000, open your browser on http://localhost:7000/
